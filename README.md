Problem:

No matter how bad the school material is, students will always figure a way out. But for [many reasons](./doc/subject_evals.md), the material will gain no improvements. This is the root cause of many big problems:
  1) A cold and selfish school culture. Each generation does not take care of the next, so they all have to suffer the same bad material. 
  2) Other resources such as Office Hours and Piazza become heavily pressured and overcrowded 

Solution:

When a TA beautifully explains a concept to a student, that student learns profoundly from the experience. However, besides from rogue side-listeners, no other classmates will be able to benefit from that interaction. The moment is lost in time and space. The same goes if the TA was a professor or a student instead. 

Feynman tries to capture and summarize the most enlightening 1-on-1 interactions, so that without any additional effort, those experiences transform into priceless resources for the other students and future generations. 

Besides that, interactions don't have to be perfect. When one person teaches another student, and that student does the same for another student, not only will the imperfect explanations become more refined down the road, a variety of explanations will emerge in a way that reinforces and compliments each other. 

A side-product is the fact that a new culture will be established, one where students practice to explain concepts in an articulate way, and are kind to one another, not least due to the fact that they know others would do the same for them.

Feynman is: 
- [a website that let's you p-set efficiently](./doc/website_intro.md)
- an effort to improve academic material through students continually renewing/editting/creating explanations
- a place where people practice to become competent, articulate thinkers  
- a conspiracy to change MIT's student culture, then the world's. 

# Our Beliefs

1) The only reason you're at university is so you can learn with companions.  

2) School material must be constantly renewed by students.

3) Explanations must be visual and animated whenever possible.

4) The friction behind creating visual content must be reduced to a minimum 

5) Solutions must focus on the thought process 

6) If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.

7) [The best helper is not a TA, professor nor genius - but an articulate student who's had an eureka moment.](./doc/best_helper.md)

8) Academic knowledge must be completely distributed and open-source. 

9) Education must be 'result dependent' but 'method independent'.  

10) [When you see someone in hell, get ice cream with them.](./doc/never_abandon.md)

11) You go to MIT to learn how to think - you learn how to think by 

# How You Can Help 

We'd like visual, intuitive explanations to flourish at MIT. If you found parts of the curriculum to be weak, consider contributing to Feynman's collection of student explanations.
