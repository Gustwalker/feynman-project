Feynman is: 
- [a website that let's you p-set efficiently](./doc/website_intro.md)
- a place where people learn to become competent, articulate thinkers  
- a conspiracy to change MIT's student culture, then the world's. 

# Our Beliefs

1) The only reason you're at university is so you can learn with companions.  

2) School material must be constantly renewed by students.

3) Explanations must be visual and animated whenever possible.

4) The friction behind creating visual content must be reduced to a minimum 

5) Solutions must focus on the thought process 

6) If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.

7) [The best helper is not a TA, professor nor genius - but an articulate student who's had an eureka moment.](./doc/best_helper.md)

8) Academic knowledge must be completely distributed and open-source. 

9) Education must be 'result dependent' but 'method independent'.  

10) [When you see someone in hell, get ice cream with them.](./doc/never_abandon.md)

# How You Can Help 

We'd like visual, intuitive explanations to flourish at MIT. If you found parts of the curriculum to be weak, consider contributing to Feynman's collection of student explanations.
