[1-minute video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsbHQWGIQ9Q)

Feynman is a website where students solve problems together - no matter where they are.

1) Students learn through the Feynman technique. Everyone learns through teaching each other.
2) It has visual explanations created by students to complement the rigor of school material. 
3) It centralizes and curates important information from Stellar, Piazza, Edx and Csail into one place.

# Our Beliefs

1) Subpar material must never persist for more than one class generation. 

2) If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it. There are no exceptions. 

3) [The best helper is not a TA, professor nor a genius - but an articulate student who's had an eureka moment.](./doc/best_helper.md)

  1) He understands the material, and, more importantly, he has fresh memory of what it's like to not understand. He is able to leverage that to effectively guide his peers towards their own Eureka moments.
  2) He's already acquired the context surrounding the specific question. He can help without a large initial overhead. 
  3) In the moment of delight, he's natural urge is to share his newfound understanding. While he teaches "en route", he's consolidating his newfound understanding with minimal extra commitment.

4) Knowledge must be open-source. Education should be 'result dependent', but 'method independent'. 

5) There's nothing more powerful than to be able to learn with companions. That's the reason why you're at MIT. 

# How You Can Help 

We'd like visual, intuitive explanations to flourish at MIT. If you found parts of the curriculum to be weak, consider contributing to Feynman's collection of student explanations.
