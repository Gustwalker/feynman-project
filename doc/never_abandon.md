Walking upon the open fairway, pushing my rugged golf trolley, I felt a gentle breeze from ahead. 
My dog followed beside me, sniffing along the floor. I looked up at the sky. It was grey, but not hopeless. Right there and then, I made a grand promise: 

"The things that had happened to me...I'll ensure nobody else will have to go through them..."

But it's too easy to betray yourself on vague, unsubstantiated promises.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few months later, it was my sophomore year, I fell into a pit, metaphorically speaking, yet again. 
This time, a TA saved me...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I met a freshman girl whose name I will not share here... Her character was symbolically appropriate too - a freshman who needed a sophomore. A girl who needed a boy...
The brutal truth is that - wanting to help doesn't mean you can help. 
And there's nothing worse than to not be able to do anything while watching someone else go through hell. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It dawned on me. It's not about the TA, nor the occassional helper. It's about having a companion, someone who needed her as much as she needed them. To not have to walk to Office Hours alone, and walk back into the quiet dorm in the silent night... To have someone who shares the joy of solving a problem and the pain of getting stuck... That's what she needed...but how exactly could I help with that? 

Without her even knowing, she revealed to me the demon that haunted me only just then. Now able to spectate as an outsider, an idea emerged...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I never knew my opportunity for redemption would arrive so fast. The worthlessness that comes from knowing that you'd never be able to repay the debt to your helpers... The forgotten promise I made under the sky... It was then
that I decided to confront this complex problem head on and see where it leads...

The path became clear. My life's purpose suddenly converges onto this one unlikely project. It's not just about others - it's about confronting my own demon for good. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To everyone who helped me, to the TA who renamed my variables, to my nameless friend, and to myself: 
I will make MIT truly a paradise. Just wait and see.
