Walking upon the open fairway, pushing my rugged golf trolley, I felt a gentle breeze from ahead. 
My dog followed beside me, sniffing along the floor. I looked up at the sky. It was grey, but not hopeless. Right there and then, I made a grand promise: 

"The things that had happened to me...I'll ensure nobody else will have to go through them..."

But it's too easy to betray yourself on vague, unsubstantiated promises.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few months later, it was my sophomore year, I fell into a pit, metaphorically speaking, yet again. 
This time, a TA saved me...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I met a freshman girl whose name I will not share here... Her character was symbolically appropriate too - a freshman who needed a sophomore. A girl who needed a boy...
The brutal truth is that - wanting to help doesn't mean you can help. 
And there's nothing worse than to not be able to do anything while watching someone else go through hell. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It dawned on me. It's not about the TA, nor the occassional helper. It's about having a companion, someone who needed her as much as she needed them. To not have to walk to Office Hours alone, to have someone who shares the joy of solving a problem and the pain of getting stuck... That's what she needed...but how exactly could I help?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I never knew my opportunity for redemption would arrive so fast. The forgotten promise I made under the sky... It was then
that I decided to confront this complex problem head on and see where it leads...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so, to everyone who helped me, to the TA who renamed my variables, and to my nameless friend: 
I will make MIT truly a paradise. Just give me a little more time.
