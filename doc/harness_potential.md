# TL;DR

## Problem: 
In study groups and Office Hours, elegant explanations are passed around all the time – but none is “captured”. 
## Solution: 
Feynman lets students generate elegant explanations as by-products of their discussions

# Exposition

Feynman's goal is to minimize the cost of creating elegant explanations. 

Everything starts with a question. "What is the intuition behind P = NP?". A classmate responds, and invites you to a classroom. He draws on the whiteboard, and soon the doodles come to life. 

He focuses on the thought process: 
"Notice that the complexity class of the oracle machine is ... that's exactly the same as ..." 
"Why do the sets intersect there?" 
"Ah, I'm glad that you asked that, it's because..."
...
...
...
"There's a quote that beautifully encapsulates the concept: 

If P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place...There would be no special value in "creative leaps,"...Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss..."

"I like that."
...
...
...
"Ohhhh, everything makes sense now!" 

That magical Eureka moment, the inexplicable journey from chaos to clarity that you just undertook - how wonderful. 

"Thank you for that - my friends and I really struggled with the last few lectures..." 
"Happy to help. If your friends still have problems with this, just try explaining to them the same thing. Remember what Richard Feynman said - if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it." 
"Yes."
"And, one more thing, in case you forget what I said..."

He presses a button, and right before your eyes, the messy scribbles on the whiteboard clear up. Then strokes start reappearing and rearranging themselves. Venn diagrams, Directed Acylic Graphs and equations, everything that he talked about and scribbled came back to life - like a vivid dance of words and numbers, moving in harmony to convey meaning in the most elegant of ways. It was as if you relived the journey once more. 

"Good luck for your midterm. Remember, always spread the joy of learning to the people around you!"

And just like that, he disappears. You remain, smiling, pondering about what had just happened.

The site has a realtime chat and whiteboard. With one click of a button, any explanation can be saved. The result is a "Journey" - an animated doodle accompanied by the relevant chat log. The best Journeys then go on to become invaluable learning resources for all other students.

1-on-1 teaching interactions, if "captured",  become priceless learning resources for other students:

You are observing your friend Adam, who understands f*ck all about Thermodynamics. Then, suddenly, he visits the TA's office. You wonder what's going on in there behind closed doors, but before long, Adam emerges again. "Eureka!", he says, "I get it now!".

WTF could have possibly happened? Perhaps, the key to the mystery is to be uncovered in their full conversation in front of the whiteboard (which is now simply lost in time and space). 

If you could somehow reconstruct the interaction, then summarize the essence of it, perhaps that'd be more valuable than any textbook or videos on the internet. 

Problem:

No matter how bad the school material is, students will always figure a way out. But for [many reasons](./doc/subject_evals.md), the material will gain no improvements. This is the root cause of many big problems:
  1) A cold and selfish school culture. Each generation does not take care of the next, so they all have to suffer the same bad material. 
  2) Other resources such as Office Hours and Piazza become heavily pressured and overcrowded 

Solution:

When a TA beautifully explains a concept to a student, that student learns profoundly from the experience. However, besides from rogue side-listeners, no other classmates will be able to benefit from that interaction. The moment is lost in time and space. The same goes if the TA was a professor or a student instead. 

Feynman tries to capture and summarize the most enlightening 1-on-1 interactions, so that without any additional effort, those experiences transform into priceless resources for the other students and future generations. 

Besides that, interactions don't have to be perfect. When one person teaches another student, and that student does the same for another student, not only will the imperfect explanations become more refined down the road, a variety of explanations will emerge in a way that reinforces and compliments each other. 

A side-product is the fact that a new culture will be established, one where students practice to explain concepts in an articulate way, and are kind to one another, not least due to the fact that they know others would do the same for them.
