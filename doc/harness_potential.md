You are observing your friend Adam, who understands f*ck all about Thermodynamics. Then, suddenly, he visits the TA's office. You wonder what's going on in there behind closed doors, but before long, Adam emerges again. "Eureka!", he says, "I get it now!".

WTF could have possibly happened? Perhaps, the key to the mystery is to be uncovered in their full conversation in front of the whiteboard (which is now simply lost in time and space). 

If you could somehow reconstruct the interaction, then summarize the essence of it, perhaps that'd be more valuable than any textbook or videos on the internet. 

Problem:

No matter how bad the school material is, students will always figure a way out. But for [many reasons](./doc/subject_evals.md), the material will gain no improvements. This is the root cause of many big problems:
  1) A cold and selfish school culture. Each generation does not take care of the next, so they all have to suffer the same bad material. 
  2) Other resources such as Office Hours and Piazza become heavily pressured and overcrowded 

Solution:

When a TA beautifully explains a concept to a student, that student learns profoundly from the experience. However, besides from rogue side-listeners, no other classmates will be able to benefit from that interaction. The moment is lost in time and space. The same goes if the TA was a professor or a student instead. 

Feynman tries to capture and summarize the most enlightening 1-on-1 interactions, so that without any additional effort, those experiences transform into priceless resources for the other students and future generations. 

Besides that, interactions don't have to be perfect. When one person teaches another student, and that student does the same for another student, not only will the imperfect explanations become more refined down the road, a variety of explanations will emerge in a way that reinforces and compliments each other. 

A side-product is the fact that a new culture will be established, one where students practice to explain concepts in an articulate way, and are kind to one another, not least due to the fact that they know others would do the same for them.
