Problem: it's hard to find study partners

Current Solutions:
  1. Facebook Group Chat: 
     - low response rate 
     - unlikely to be on the same parts of the p-set 
     
  2. Piazza:
     - not live 
     - students rarely respond 
     - instructor answers lack empathy / have to be intentionally vague since it's completely public
