Q: How exactly will this tool enable students to better explain concepts to each other?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Answer:

If by "better" you mean "the medium of the website allows students to be more expressive", You're right, the website right now does NOT make it easy for students to explain concepts online in a visual/better way.
However, if by "better" you mean "students themselves become better explainers", then the tool achieves that by incentivizing them to want to be better, and then giving them frictionless opportunities to practise explaining.

Long Answer: 

If the tool successfully initiates the chain reaction, such that each student teaches two other students, here are the logical conclusions: 

1) The tool incentivizes students to be better at explaining concepts

At MIT, there aren’t many reasons to devote time and energy to improve your explanation skills. 
Part of it is because of culture: “If many people are bad at explaining and unwilling to help, why should I? Nobody really asks for my help anyway. "

Feynman differs in that: 
	1) The website subculture creates a positive cycle: “everyone was kind and articulate, so I’ll be the same"
	2) Students see that the top explainers gain recognition (think Quora upvotes and Github stars)
        3) Each individual also see that they’re help causes ripple-effects (the website will allow visualization of the “chain-reaction”)

2) The tool makes it painless to explain things. Through regular practise, students become better at explaining concepts

At MIT, it’s hard to find help from peers. And even if you’re done, it’s hard to find people who need your help.
(Not that you’d scout for people to help after you’re done in the first place). 

Feynman differs in that:
	1) It does what websites do best - matches people who want to find each other but couldn’t before. 
	    Therefore, all the friction previously associated with helping and getting helped is almost nullified. 
        2) The explanations are “stored”, and publicly viewable (as supposed to “transient” and “private" like a TA helping one student Office Hours).
	    By being exposed to many great explanations (which they're otherwise not exposed to), students get an intuition for what makes explanations great.

However, currently, this tool does not achieve those ideals. Far from that, users can only chat with each other - quite ironic for a platform that attempts to let visual, intuitive explanations to flourish. Also, we made a huge assumption: “IF each student teaches two other students”. This is why I’m recruiting collaborators to ensure that the vision can be actualized in reasonable time. 

Here’s how I plan to move forward: 

I believe nothing beats having students meet up and draw in front of a white board. I don’t know if you heard about Progressive Web Apps. Essentially, it allows the website to run on phones as native apps, with access to geolocation data. 
I’d like to use that to match people who happen to be on the same question and are within X meters away. 

Otherwise, I heavily prioritize increasing the expressivity of the “Chat” component. I’m thinking of an interactive white board in the chat, which’d work very well for tablet users. Perhaps supporting video calls is a potential workaround for laptop users to draw diagrams, but I don't like it very much.

Q: What's the difference between Feynman and Piazza?

Short answer: 

The help you'd find in Feynman is more "empathetic" since it's student-run, and asking a series of quick clarifications is painless. With that said, Feynman and Piazza focus on different things. There will always be times where you need instructors/TAs to answer your well-constructed question. 

Long answer: 

Q1 "It centralizes and curates important information from Stellar, Piazza, Edx and Csail into one place."
    From what I saw, it does not really display them, so what is the difference from piazza note with links?

A1: In the MVP, relevant information will be displayed. Having said that, I think that even if Feynman only contains links, there is intrinsic value to a site that's fundamentally organized around questions, with each question's "dependencies" easily accessible in a centralized place. 
  
Q2: It has visual explanations created by students to complement the rigor of school material.
    Unless you provide good tool to do that, not a lot of people will actually take time and draw something
  
A2: That's true. I myself find it a hassle to even upload a pre-saved image. 
    Having said that, I believe that if I was helped effectively, saved about an hour of pointlessly getting stuck, and reached an Eureka moment, I'd be more willing to upload visual explanations. In the chain reaction, the people in the last layer are primarily responsible for this. 
    
Another point is that, even if "not a lot of people" will take the time and draw something, that's fine too. It only takes one great explanation to benefit the next generation of students. The default, as it is, is that nothing gets passed from one generation ot the next. 

Q3: "Students learn through the Feynman technique. Here, everybody teaches, and everybody gets helped."
    Same basically happens on piazza

A3: It's a good point. Students can collectively craft answers to responses. From time to time, I myself get impressed by the quality of student responses on Piazza.  However, I believe a public group setting removes the sense of individual urgency and responsibility, so it's probably the case that only a minority of students on Piazza contribute. That addresses the "everybody teaches" part. 

With regard to the other point: it's very impressive that one can get responses from instructors from Piazza within 15 minutes. Therefore, "everybody gets helped" on Piazza is an accurate statement. That's not where the difference lie. Instead, the difference lies in what the help IS. On Piazza, help is the written response of an instructor to a structured question. Feynman's belief is that the student undergoing the Eureka moment, in most cases, is better than any TA or instructor at helping a person who is stuck. It's live chat is 1-on-1 which makes asking a series of short questions and followups very painless. 

Summary: 
I think Feynman and Piazza are different and compliment each other. There are times where you simply need a professor to answer your question. Still, more often than that, students who use Piazza are actually just looking for clarifications, hints, pointers to resources or a more "empathetic" explanation that is more intuitive and visual. In those cases, Feynman is optimized for those use cases.
