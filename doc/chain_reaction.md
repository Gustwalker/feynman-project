There are two groups of users: Feynmen and Students. 

Everyone starts off as students. A student becomes a Feynman when he presses the "Eureka" button. 

At the start, Feynmen are in short supply. Students can talk among each other. Any student may get help instantly from a Feynman - if one is available - but he is required to pass on his knowledge to two other students later when he becomes a Feynman himself. 

As the reaction develops, there will be more Feynmen available. Therefore, students can get help without as much of the conditional responsibility previously required.
